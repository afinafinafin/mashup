	<p style="background-color: rgb(180, 180, 180);">Meet our most innovative design, re-engineered to be our slimmest, lightest Galaxy Z Fold ever. Expansive screens inside and out show you a new, undisrupted world of craftsmanship. When folded, Galaxy Z Fold7’s 16.48 cm cover screen now features a 21:9 aspect ratio, similar to bar-type premium smartphones. This improvement allows for more natural typing, enhancing your productivity. You can also unfold to work on the most expansive screen on Galaxy smartphones, measuring 20.31 cm corner-to-corner to provide a more seamless multitasking experience.</p>

	<p style="background-color: #ffffff; ">Whether folded or unfolded, Galaxy Z Fold7 exceeds your expectations of a smartphone with a significantly trimmed down design. Unfolded, it measures 0.42 cm thick, and folded it is 0.89 cm thick, making it roughly 25% slimmer than Galaxy Z Fold6. This thinner form comes with a weight of just 215 g, so it's the lightest, most portable Galaxy Z Fold yet.</p>
